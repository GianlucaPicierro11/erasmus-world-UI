                <span>Cookies
                    and other technologies allow a site or services to know if your computer or device has
                    visited it before. These technologies can then be used to deliver products, services, and
                    ads, help us understand how the site or service is being used, help you navigate between
                    pages efficiently, help us remember your preferences, and generally improve your experience
                    in using our services. Cookies can also help ensure marketing you see online is more
                    relevant to you and your interests.

                <span><b>Why
                        does Erasmus World Application use cookies and similar technologies?</b></span><br>
                <span>We
                    use cookies, pixels, local storage, and similar technologies to show you relevant content,
                    improve your experience, and help protect Erasmus World Application and our users. <i>We may use
                        these
                        technologies to deliver the service, provide you with a service that is easy to use,
                        enable you to move around the Service and use its features, such as accessing secure
                        areas, and store information so that Erasmus World Application responds faster.</i> We may use
                    these
                    technologies to collect information about how you use the Service, for example which pages
                    you go to most often and whether you get error messages from certain pages. <i>We may use
                        these technologies to allow us to remember choices you make (such as your user name,
                        language or the region you're in) and tailor the Service to provide enhanced features
                        and content for you. These cookies can also be used to remember changes you've made to
                        text size, font, and other parts of pages that you can customize.</i> Erasmus World Application
                    or our
                    advertising partners may use these technologies to deliver advertising that is relevant to
                    your interests. These technologies can remember that your device has visited a site or
                    service, and may also be able to track your device's browsing activity on other sites or
                    services other than Erasmus World Application. This information may be shared with organizations
                    outside
                    Erasmus World Application, such as advertisers and/or advertising networks to deliver the
                    advertising, and
                    to help measure the effectiveness of an advertising campaign. *We may use these technologies
                    to understand, improve, and research products and services.
